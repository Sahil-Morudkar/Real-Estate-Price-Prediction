    <p> Real Estate Property is not only the basic need of a man but today it also represents the riches
and prestige of a person. Investment in real estate generally seems to be profitable because their
property values do not decline rapidly. Changes in the real estate price can affect various
household investors, bankers, policy makers and many. Sales forecasting has always been a very
significant area to concentrate upon. Manual infestation of being able to predict House Prices
could lead to drastic errors leading to poor management of the organization, and most
importantly would be time consuming. <b> This webapp helps you do all of that, Just enter your requirements and get to know the price of the house you're looking for. </b>
